The aim of this project is to automate an excel spreadsheet which has been used in a competition between my friends where we make predictions on the fifteen six nations rugby games.

We have been using this sheet for ten years or more and after an exhaustive search I have been unable to find a source for this spreadsheet, in fact I cannot even get agreement on who introduced it to us.
