**** The Game
****
The concept behind this game is fairly simple, each entrant has to pick either a home win, an away win or a draw for each of the fifteen games in the series. They then have to assign a weighting between one and fifteen to each of their picks, with each number being used only once.

The scores are calculated as follows:\
Correct prediction â€“ weighting is added to the players score.\
Incorrect prediction - weighting is subtracted from the players score.\
Draws - if the player correctly predicts a draw, then the weighting is doubled and added to the players score, an incorrect draw prediction results in the weighting being subtracted from the players score.
